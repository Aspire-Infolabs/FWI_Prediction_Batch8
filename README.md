This project focuses on building a Fire Weather Index (FWI) Predictor that estimates wildfire risk using essential environmental and fire-danger features such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, and BUI. The dataset is thoroughly cleaned, pre-processed, and analysed to ensure reliable inputs, followed by visual exploration to understand feature distributions and relationships. Machine learning techniques are then applied to learn how weather conditions influence fire danger levels, enabling accurate prediction of the FWI value. The system also incorporates regional information to study area-wise fire behaviour and improve prediction relevance. Overall, the model aims to support early detection, risk assessment, and informed decision-making for effective wildfire management.
