**Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction System**

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index, 
which indicates the risk of forest fire occurrence based on weather and environmental conditions.
This project helps users understand whether the current weather conditions indicate a Low, Moderate, High, or Extreme fire risk.

**What is Fire Weather Index (FWI)?**

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is an internationally used numerical index that represents the potential intensity of a forest fire.
It is calculated using meteorological parameters such as: Temperature ,Relative Humidity ,Wind Speed, Rainfall etc
Higher FWI values indicate higher fire danger.
