🔥 Fire Weather Index (FWI) Predictor

A Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using environmental and fire-danger parameters. The system helps assess wildfire risk levels and supports early warning and decision-making for forest fire management.



📌 Project Statement

Wildfires are strongly influenced by weather and environmental conditions. This project focuses on building an intelligent system that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using historical data and machine learning techniques.The project covers the complete ML lifecycle — from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Flask web application.This project was developed as part of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship Program.



🎯 Problem Outcomes

a.Analysed weather and fire-related data affecting wildfire behavior.

b.Build a reliable ML model for predicting Fire Weather Index (FWI).

c.Deployed the trained model as a user-friendly web application.

d.Classified wildfire risk into Low, Moderate, High, and Extreme levels.

✅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the complete development and deployment of a Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction System using machine learning. By analyzing key environmental and fire-related parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and fire danger indices, the system is able to accurately predict the Fire Weather Index and classify wildfire risk levels.It can assist forest departments, disaster management authorities, researchers, and environmental planners in early detection, preparedness, and informed decision-making. With further enhancements such as real-time data integration and advanced models, the system can be extended into a powerful tool for wildfire monitoring and prevention.
