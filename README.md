Fire Weather Index (FWI) Predictor
A Machine Learning–based web application to predict Fire Weather Index (FWI) using environmental and fire-danger parameters. Developed as part of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship Program.

Problem Statement:-
Wildfires pose a serious threat to ecosystems, human life, and property. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a globally used indicator to estimate forest fire danger based on weather conditions and fuel moisture content.

This project aims to develop an end-to-end Fire Weather Index prediction system using machine learning. The system processes key meteorological and fire-related parameters, predicts the FWI value, classifies fire risk levels, and presents the results through a user-friendly Flask web application. The goal is to support early warning, risk assessment, and informed decision-making for wildfire management.

Project Outcomes:-

Trained a Ridge Regression model to predict Fire Weather Index

Applied StandardScaler for consistent feature normalization

Evaluated multiple regression models and selected the best performer

Deployed the trained model using a Flask web application

Displayed predicted FWI value along with fire risk level, causes, and precautions
