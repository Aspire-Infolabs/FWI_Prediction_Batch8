    <h1>Fire Weather Index Prediction System</h1>
    <p>
        The <b>Fire Weather Index (FWI)</b> is a numerical rating that indicates
        the intensity of fire danger based on weather conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project uses <b>Machine Learning (Ridge Regression)</b> to predict
        fire risk by analyzing environmental factors such as temperature,
        humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.
